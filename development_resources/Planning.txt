How to spin, lift, and fly:

To lift the motors simply speed together to lift the aircraft higher.

To move side to side or forwards and backwards 2 rotors spin faster than the other 2 and this causes the one side to lift higher and therefore angle the quadcopter to begin moving in the direction requested form the TX. So for moving sideways, or forwards and backwards the flight controller simply picks the correct motors to speed up or slow down.

To rotate the quadcopter while hovering in the same space either the CW or CCW motors spin slightly faster than their counterparts which slow down slightly to still overall produce the same amount of lift as before but causing the quad to pivot on its Yaw axis.

group CW    = group({m2, m3});

group all   = group({m1, m2, m3, m4});

GCTRL drone = GCTRL("Type"); // Type = "Tri", "Vtail", "QuadT", "QuadX", "Hex6", "Hex6X", "Oct8T", "Oct8X", or any other type is "Custom"
